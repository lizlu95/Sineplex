We pretty much did what we planned for, with small modifications as we go and see the project clearer as a whole. We worked almost entirely remotely, with several group meetings before the milestones. We communicate through FB and use stash to work together. 
For the milestones we all meet together and discuss to arrive at a set of answers. We use Google docs to continue our work when we are not together. For the final project itself, I did the UI part along with some modifications on the PHP part just to make everything more compatible. I managed to make the UI from plain text to be much more user-friendly, although the big picture constrained me on how much I could modify. I feel if we had more time we could let the query part to make more sense and so will the UI. 

Zijing Lu: 5. Without the work I have done the project would be bare-boned and plain and to a degree not complete.
Xi Yang: 4. She helped us to test and debug and write queries as we build up this project, also provided some important insights on how the big picture should look like. 
Haoming Sun: 3. She didn't do a major part of the project but she helped each of us to solve the problems as we go. 
Patrick Tseng: 5. With his skill in PHP and the help to host the web on our own I would say he put significant effort into this project.

I spent ~35 hrs on the project. I feel like the group size is bigger than what we need, 2-3 people would be the best and more efficient. I liked that it involves a lot of self-learning, which has enhanced my skills in many aspects.
